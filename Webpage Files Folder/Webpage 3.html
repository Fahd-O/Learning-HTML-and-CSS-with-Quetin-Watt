      26. Pseudo Classes: Yet another seletor like tag styled in CSS3_External_Style_Sheet. see CSS3_External_Style_Sheet for styling.<br/>
         Example
         <h4> Life is a test, Mankind has a sworn enemy, again Life is a test, don't get too attached. Let him who will take heed and take 
            this life for what it really is, a test!!!<br/> 
            When the overwhelming event eventually come to pass 1 None will deny its coming to pass 2 It will bring some high and some low 3 
            When the earth is shaken with a violent shake 4 and the mountains crumbles to pieces 5 becoming dust scattered abroad 6 then shall
            you be sorted into three 7 Then the companions of the right, what refers to the companions of the right 8 and the companions of 
            the left, what refers to the companions of the left 9 and the foremost will be foremost 10 those will be closest to your lord 11 
            in blissfull paradise 12 a number from those of old 13 and a few from later times 12 ...
         </h4>
         <h2> what </h2>
         <h2> you</h2>
         <h2> see </h2>
         <h2> isn't </h2>
         <h2> what </h2>
         <h2> you </h2>
         <h2> get </h2>
         <h2> with HTML5 and CSS3 </h2>
      27. Pseudo Child Selector: Special styling features is associated with Pseudo class selector. a tag can be within another tag and when
         one tag is inside another tag, it becomes a child of the outer tag. So now with Pseudo Child Selector, you can style the first-child
         or last-child or both and thats if you have multiple child tags within the parent tag, there's also a feature to add content or text
         to the rigth and/or left of every paragraph from top to bottom, note that <strong> child </strong>  here means
         a tag within the <strong> parent tag </strong> . See CSS3_External_Style_Sheet_W3. 
         <div id="al-abween">
          <p> seek beneficial knowledge, even if it is in china, go in search of it </p>
          <p> The earth is egg-like in shape </p>
          <p> loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading loading </p>
          <p> open close open close open close open close open close open close open close open close open close open close open close open </p>
          <p> each day passing by is a reminder itself, reflect!!! </p>
         </div>
      28. nth Child Pseudo Class:used to select specified paragraphs. after typing nth-child in CSS3_External_Style_Sheet_W3, then place in
         arc brackets() the value "even" to select all even paragraphs, "odd" to select all odd paragraphs, 1, 2, 3... to select the 1st, 2nd,
         3rd... paragraph  1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n... to select every 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th... paragraph.<br/>
      29. Styling Links: There are four aspects of a link. There is the 'default appearance state' and is how the link text appears, it should
         be noted that by default i.e. without styling it usually appears as blue underlined text. The 'hover state' i.e. what happens when
         the cursor is floating directly on top of the link, the 'active state' i.e. what happens when the link is clicked on and lastly the
         'visited state' i.e. what it looks like after the link has been clicked on and visited. see CSS3_External_Style_Sheet_W3 for styling.
